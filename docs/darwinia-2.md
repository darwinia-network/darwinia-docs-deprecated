# Darwinia 2.0 Is Coming 🧬 

For Darwinia 1.0(Darwinia Chain, Darwinia Parachain, and Darwinia Smartchain), we are currently working on a merging. Darwinia 1.0 will be discontinued following the merge, and Darwinia 2.0 will be launched by a referendum vote of Darwinia 1.0's on-chain community.

There will be just one mainnet chain left after the merge, which is the DARWINIA 2.

* Mainnet: Darwinia 2.0 
* Canary network: Crab 2.0
* Testnet: Pangolin 2.0, Pangoro 2.0

## About Darwinia 2.0

Darwinia 2.0 will provide a stronger foundation for the future development of Darwinia, leading to higher code quality, faster development iteration cycles, shorter cross-chain routing paths, and a better user experience.
