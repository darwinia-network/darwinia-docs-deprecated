**What is Scale**

Scale is a substrate JSON-RPC API client and libraries implemented in ruby language for general use. It contains the implementation of low-level data formats, various substrate types and also supports metadata. This work is the prerequisite of our subsequent series of projects. We hope to easily access Polkadot and Substrate through our familiar language ruby, such that the applications based on Polkadot / Substrate can be developed at a fast pace. We plan to develop some substrate-based web games. The back end of these applications is prepared to be developed in ruby language, and then interact with nodes or synchronize data through RPC.
