**For this Grand Prix, Darwinia will provide 100 Million CRING rewards.** All rewards can be exchanged for the mainnet RING after the Darwinia Mainnet launched at the ratio of 100:1.

## 2020–05–29: Darwinia will be fair in this Crab Node Grand Prix, the following is a supplementary explanation of the competition rules:

\1. The Online Time and Times of Dropped Connections are the main ranking criteria, while the number blocks produced by nodes is only for reference. Therefore, the participants do not need to worry about losing points if not being elected as an active validator. Active validators, standby validators, and full nodes will be treated fairly.

\2. The ranking algorithm only references the 7-day data (Online Time & Times of Dropped Connections) from 10:00 AM on June 04, 2020 to 10:00 AM on June 10 (UTC + 8: 00). Therefore, the node has nearly a week to prepare and test, so that the node can run steadily.

# # Introduction

On May 11, 2020, Darwinia launched the Crab Network.

Crab Network (Crab for short) is a Canary Network for Darwinia. The positioning of Crab is similar to Polkadot’s Kusama Network. Expect Chaos is a reasonable expectation.

After two weeks of internal testing, the Crab has been able to run stably. In order to allow more users/developers to participate in the operation of the Crab, **Darwinia decided to launch the Crab Node Grand Prix: Darwinia Project Moon.**

**For this Grand Prix, Darwinia will provide 100 Million CRING rewards.** All rewards can be exchanged for the mainnet RING after the Darwinia Mainnet launched at the ratio of 100:1.

> \2. The address needs to have a balance, CRING can be got at the faucet.
