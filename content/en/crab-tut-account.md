## Add Account / Restore JSON

### Add Account

Please back up the Mnemonic / Raw Seed, JSON, etc. when creating an account. When backing up JSON, please pay attention to remember well the password. If the password is lost, the address cannot be restored through JSON, but it can be imported again through Mnemonic / Raw Seed.

### Restore JSON

If you have created an account and have JSON, you can choose Restore JSON directly.

### Pay Attention

To save storage space, accounts with less than 1 cRING will be considered as dust addresses and no operations can be performed. Therefore, you need to recharge a certain number of RINGs for the address, please reserve a certain number of RINGs as transation fee.
